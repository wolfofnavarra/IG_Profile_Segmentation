# IG_Profile_Segmentation
Python script to segment the profiles you follow based on what their content is about. 

For this script to function, make sure you make a folder in the same path called "credentials" and inside you make a e.nv file with the following content:

INSTAGRAM_USERNAME=username
INSTAGRAM_PASSWORD=password

Replace the values with your own username and password.

Have in mind, there are some security breaches that might be broken if you run this script (accordint to IG/Meta).
